"# Investigating-Existing-Analytic-Tools-to-Design-an-Integrated-Visual-Analytic-Tool-to-Aid-Classwork-" 

This project is in developing stage.

The project objective is to investigate different visualization and machine learning tools on class work datasets which can be used to build an integrated visual analytic tool. The goal is that this visual analytic tool will provide insights for the instructor to understand class performance. These insights will even help in improving the performance of the struggling students.
